      <br>
      <h3>General Notes on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website</h3>
      <p>If you have given your consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are

        transmission of personal data to these external entities is necessary. We only disclose personal data to
        external entities if it is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so
        (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure according to
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data disclosure. In the use of data
        processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid data processing agreement. In the
        case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have
        already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
      <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
        OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, INCLUDING PROFILING BASED
        ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROCESSING CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU
        OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE
        GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE
        ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
      <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
        TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL
        SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
      <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged
        violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of
        a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the
        direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is
        technically feasible.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
      <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your
        stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing, and, if necessary, a
        right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for other questions regarding
        personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do so, you can
        contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
          duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing
          instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you
          have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your
          interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
          restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; apart from their storage
        &ndash; may only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising, or defending legal
        claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest
        of the European Union or a member state.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
      <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that
        you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock
        symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read
        by third parties.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
      <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which
        your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These data are not merged with other data sources.</p>
      <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
        the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website – for this purpose, the server log files
        must be recorded.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Inquiry via Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
      <p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry)
        will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data
        without your consent.</p>
      <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, insofar as your request is related to the
        fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other
        cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to
        us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be
        revoked at any time.</p>
      <p>The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your
        consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after completion of your request).
        Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
